## Desktop Automation at its finest

This project started as a simple collection of hotkeys and predefined phrases, in AutoHotKey, for my personal use. It was primarily created to help with blogging for two of my sites, http://unregistered.gr and http://pipesmag.com.

As my needs expanded and time passed, it grew into a monstrosity, a collection of hotkeys, phrases, scripts-inside-scripts and external tools. It was then that I realized that a) I'd have to remake it from scratch in a more "modular" way, for better maintenance but, more importantly, that b) others might also be interested in stuff like that.

So, here it is. Yes, we start with nothing but this readme. I'll try to upload the first bits and pieces as soon as time allows. No promises :-)

Ah, and thanks for stopping by (and reading all of this).
